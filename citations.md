   ```CLAM_steel_Data.png``` contains data for path E (where only pure axial strain is being applied). The data is a hysteresis loop for CLAM, a RAFM steel developed by the Chinese. The other paths may be interesting to investigate, but I found this to be the most useful graph from the report with regards to LCF strain-controlled testing.

   ```RAFM_Steel_Data.png``` contains strain-controlled hysteresis loop data for EUROFER97 at 550C and a hold time of 3 minutes in tension (red dashed line) or compression (blue line). The plot is also at the Nf/2 cycle (half the number of cycles until failure).
   For ```RAFM_Steel_Data_2.png```, the plot shows the same conditions except that it is comparing a hold time in compression (blue) and a hold time in tension-compression (green dashed).

   The mechanical properties of V44 were investigated using a technique known as in-situ high energy X-ray diffraction (XRD) tensile testing at varying temperatures. This paper also gives the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength for V44 at varying temperatures. ```V44_Tensile_Strength_Data.png``` contains the data for tensile tests at 3 different temperatures.
